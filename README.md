# Retrieval-Augmented Generation Project

This project demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It uses language models and vector search to answer questions about documents you provide. The repository is intended as a starting point for experiments with RAG workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

The repository currently contains only the basic structure. Add your application code under `src/` and launch it with `streamlit` or your preferred entry point. A typical command might look like:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Project Goals

- Provide a minimal template for building RAG-based applications
- Outline required dependencies and basic usage instructions
- Serve as a foundation for further exploration of retrieval and generation techniques
